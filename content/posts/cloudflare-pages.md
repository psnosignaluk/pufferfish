Configured Cloudflare Pages for the talking face of this service. It's a relatively simple thing to get going.
In my case, running a Hugo-based SSG, its a case of selecting Hugo from the options menu and setting the `Build Command`
and `Build Output directory`. Note that in my case, I had to change the `hugo` build directive to `hugo -D` in order
to get this to work properly for me. Have a looksee at the configuration I've used for this:

Once you have this set up, it's a quick matter of running the builder to deploy the code to Cloudflare.

Now this is where stuff gets interesting. For approximately $0 per month, my code
lives in a server that's close to home for me (London, UK), but also pretty damn close to
other people across the globe.

Here's a `curl -I https://pufferfish.cc` lookup from my machine against the site:

Here's a lookup against using a NordVPN AMS server:

All of this for free and for nothing. That is awesome.
