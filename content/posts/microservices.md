Microservices. They're a tricky issue. In a lot of cases, microservices make sense because they
allow you to scaffold an architecture together because it makes sense to have a singular service
running a signular purpose that you can put together in a broad architecture that makes sense
to your platform.

I see a fair amount of writing these days that talks about microservices and their impact on
how engineers run their platforms.
