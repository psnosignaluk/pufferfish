Three weeks ago, I received a diagnosis of brain and lung cancer, which was a rather interesting situation to run into.
I've since had brain surgery to remove two tumors from my skull and am the recovery path at home. I additionally have
lung cancer treatment to deal with, which is creating some interesting times in our house.

One of the things that has troubled me the most is that I'm currently suffering from a speech impediment. Some stuff is
amusing, such as calling vegan meat slices "sandwich blankets". Other stuff isn't quite so cool, like forgetting what
things are called and being unable to string together a coherent sentence from time to time. This got me to thinking that
I need to do something with tech to improve my speech ability and keep myself going if it all possible, or
at least identify issues with my speech over time and try to work on whatever problems we identify.

To this end, a small fleet of FreeBSD pets will be needed. Everything in my current job is cattle. I need some loved pets in
my life to play with, upgrade and nurse. I also need to write code, muck around with Cloudflare and generally have a good time
doing this kind of thing. The objective is to take a Digital Ocean FreeBSD instance and build a shell server out of it, running
as close to 2CPU/4GB RAM as possible. This will be my maintainable box where I can practise my skills and experiment. The other
idea is to take Cloudflare Workers and find interesting ways of experimenting with those to build out some interesting code
opportunities, as well as playing with Cloudflare tools to build a secure default website for the modern internet.
