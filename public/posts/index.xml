      <description>Three weeks ago, I received a diagnosis of brain and lung cancer, which was a rather interesting situation to run into. I&amp;rsquo;ve since had brain surgery to remove two tumors from my skull and am the recovery path at home. I additionally have lung cancer treatment to deal with, which is creating some interesting times in our house.
One of the things that has troubled me the most is that I&amp;rsquo;m currently suffering from a speech impediment.</description>
